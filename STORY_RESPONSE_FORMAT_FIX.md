# Story Generation Response Format Fix

## âœ… Problem Fixed

**Frontend Expected**: `data.stories` (plural array)
**Backend Returned**: `data.story` (singular object)

## âœ… Correct Response Format

The API now returns the format the frontend expects:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recognized_objects": [
    "book",
    "table",
    "lamp",
    "chair"
  ],
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "My Scanned Objects Story",
      "content": "I used my camera to scan the objects around me...",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "sentences": [
        "I see a book on the table.",
        "The table is brown and sturdy.",
        "The lamp gives bright light.",
        "I sit on the comfortable chair."
      ],
      "vocabulary": [
        "book",
        "table",
        "lamp",
        "chair",
        "see",
        "brown",
        "light",
        "sit"
      ],
      "created_at": "2025-09-14T15:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Objects recognized and story generated from your scan (demo mode)"
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Key Changes

1. **Changed `story` to `stories`** - Frontend expects plural
2. **Made `stories` an array** - Frontend expects `data.stories[0]`
3. **Kept `success: true`** - Frontend checks this field
4. **Maintained all story fields** - title, content, sentences, vocabulary

## ðŸŽ¯ Frontend Compatibility

The frontend code:
```javascript
if (data.success && data.stories) {
  console.log("Stories generated successfully:", data.stories);
  dispatch({ type: "STORY_GENERATION_SUCCESS", payload: data.stories });
}
```

Will now work correctly because:
- âœ… `data.success` is `true`
- âœ… `data.stories` exists and is an array
- âœ… `data.stories[0]` contains the story object

## ðŸš€ Expected Result

After deployment:
- âœ… Story generation from scan will succeed
- âœ… Frontend will display the generated story
- âœ… No more "Story generation failed" errors
- âœ… Complete story workflow functional
