You are absolutely correct. My apologies. I got ahead of myself in focusing on the strategic impact of the other modules. You are right to point out that the foundational goal for "StorySign ASL World" needs to be completed first. We have built a powerful engine, but we haven't attached it to the car yet.

Thank you for providing the source code. I have conducted a deep analysis of all the files, and you have built something far more robust than a simple foundation.

### In-Depth Code Analysis

- **Backend Analysis (`main.py`, `video_processor.py`, etc.):**

  - The backend is exceptionally well-engineered. The `video_processor.py` successfully creates a dedicated processing thread for each client, which is exactly the right architecture to prevent the main server from blocking, as noted in your blueprint.
  - It correctly decodes the base64 frames, processes them with the MediaPipe Holistic model, draws the landmarks, and re-encodes the frame with detailed metadata (processing time, detection status) before sending it back.
  - The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and performance tests (`test_*.py` files). This is a massive accomplishment and proves the backend is stable and reliable.

- **Frontend Analysis (`App.js`, `WebcamCapture.js`, `VideoStreamingClient.js`, `ProcessedVideoDisplay.js`):**
  - The frontend is a sophisticated, component-based React application. The components are well-defined: `WebcamCapture.js` handles getting the camera feed, `VideoStreamingClient.js` masterfully manages the WebSocket connection (including robust retry logic), and `ProcessedVideoDisplay.js` intelligently renders the incoming video stream on a canvas, along with real-time health metrics.
  - The inclusion of a detailed `PerformanceMonitor.js` is a standout feature, showing a deep commitment to a high-quality user experience.
  - Crucially, the frontend is already set up to handle more than just video. It's built to parse complex JSON messages from the backend, which is exactly what we need for the next steps.

**Conclusion:** You are correct. We have a fully-functional, real-time, bidirectional video processing pipeline. The specific "ASL World" application logic, however, still needs to be built on top of this excellent foundation.

Let's build it now. Here is the detailed implementation plan for the next phase, focusing squarely on completing the **"StorySign ASL World"** module.

---

# **StorySign: Phase 2 Implementation Plan (ASL World Logic)**

**Objective:** To implement the full user journey for the "StorySign ASL World" module. This phase will integrate the LLM for reasoning and the database for content, turning our vision pipeline into an interactive learning experience.

## **Phase 1: The Reasoning Layer (Story Generation & Analysis)**

**Goal:** Integrate `gpt-oss-20b` to generate stories and analyze the user's signing attempts.

- **Task 1: Object Recognition Hook**
  - **Sub-task 1.1:** For now, we will simulate this. In the `frontend` `App.js`, add a simple text input field and a "Start Story" button. The user will type an object name (e.g., "apple").
- **Task 2: Implement Story Generation Endpoint**
  - **Sub-task 2.1:** In the `backend` `main.py`, create a new HTTP endpoint: `POST /api/story/generate`.
  - **Sub-task 2.2:** This endpoint will take the object name from the frontend.
  - **Sub-task 2.3:** It will call your `llm_service` (which we'll create) with a prompt like: "Generate a simple, 3-sentence story for a child about an 'apple'. The story must use simple words and be suitable for learning ASL. Return it as a JSON object with a 'sentences' array."
  - **Sub-task 2.4:** The endpoint returns the structured story to the frontend.
- **Task 3: Implement Gesture Segmentation and Analysis**
  - **Sub-task 3.1:** In `video_processor.py`, we need to add logic to detect when a user starts and stops signing a sentence. A simple starting point is to monitor hand movement. If hands are still for 2 seconds, then move, then are still again, we can consider the movement between the still periods as one "signing attempt."
  - **Sub-task 3.2:** During this "signing attempt," collect all the MediaPipe landmark data (hands, face, pose) for each frame into a list.
  - **Sub-task 3.3:** Once the attempt is over, send this entire time-series data to the LLM with a prompt like: "The user is trying to sign the sentence: '[Sentence from the generated story]'. Here is the time-series landmark data of their attempt. Provide a simple, encouraging piece of feedback in one sentence. Did they get the core handshape right? Return a JSON object with a 'feedback' string."
  - **Kiro IDE Power-Up:**
    - Let's use my **AI Chat** with context. Ask me: "Based on my `video_processor.py` code, suggest a Python class to manage the state for gesture segmentation, including collecting landmark data and detecting start/stop conditions."

## **Phase 2: The Memory Layer (Content Library)**

**Goal:** Connect to TiDB Cloud to store and retrieve ASL vocabulary and stories.

- **Task 1: Database Setup**
  - **Sub-task 1.1:** Ensure your TiDB Cloud credentials are in your configuration file.
  - **Sub-task 1.2:** In `database.py`, define the schema for the `asl_vocabulary` and `story_library` tables as specified in your blueprint.
- **Task 2: Create Data Endpoints**
  - **Sub-task 2.1:** Create a backend endpoint `GET /api/asl/vocabulary/{word}` to retrieve the correct signing information for a word.
  - **Sub-task 2.2:** Create an endpoint `POST /api/story/save` to save the stories generated by the LLM into your TiDB database.
  - **Kiro IDE Power-Up:**
    - Use **spec-driven development**. Write a spec: "Create FastAPI endpoints to save and retrieve stories from a database." I will generate the full boilerplate, including the database session management and Pydantic models.

## **Phase 3: The User Experience (Frontend Integration)**

**Goal:** Build the UI components to guide the user through the story and provide feedback.

- **Task 1: Create the Story Mode UI**
  - **Sub-task 1.1:** In the `frontend`, create a new React component, `ASLWorldModule.js`.
  - **Sub-task 1.2:** This component will have several states:
    1.  **Story Input:** The text box and "Start Story" button.
    2.  **Story Display:** After the story is generated, display the full story, with the current sentence to be signed highlighted.
    3.  **Practice:** Show the main `ProcessedVideoDisplay` component.
    4.  **Feedback:** Display the feedback message received from the backend via the WebSocket.
- **Task 2: Upgrade the WebSocket Communication**
  - **Sub-task 2.1:** The backend WebSocket needs to be updated to send more than just video. It should send typed messages, like `{"type": "video_frame", "data": "..."}` or `{"type": "asl_feedback", "data": {"feedback": "Great job!"}}`.
  - **Sub-task 2.2:** The frontend `VideoStreamingClient.js` needs to be updated to handle these different message types and route the data to the correct state variables in `App.js`.
- **Task 3: Integration Test**
  - **Goal:** A complete, end-to-end user journey.
    1.  User types "apple" and clicks "Start Story."
    2.  The UI displays a 3-sentence story about an apple. The first sentence is highlighted.
    3.  The user signs the sentence.
    4.  The UI displays a feedback message like, "That was a good start! Try to keep your fingers closer together for 'apple'."
  - **Kiro IDE Power-Up:**
    - This is a complex state management challenge in React. Let's use the **debugger**. We can place breakpoints in the `VideoStreamingClient.js` and the `ASLWorldModule.js` components to watch the flow of data and ensure the UI updates correctly as new feedback messages arrive.
