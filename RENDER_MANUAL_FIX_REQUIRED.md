# ðŸš¨ Render Manual Configuration Required

## âœ… Problem Confirmed

The logs clearly show Render is **completely ignoring render.yaml**:

- Build command: `' '` (empty) - should be using render.yaml
- Start command: `' '` (empty) - should be using render.yaml

**Root Cause**: The Render service was created with manual configuration that overrides render.yaml.

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

Since render.yaml is being ignored, you MUST configure manually in Render dashboard:

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard

1. **Open**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your service**: storysign-backend
3. **Click on the service**
4. **Go to Settings tab**

### Step 2: Set Build Command

**Find "Build Command" field and enter**:

```bash
cd StorySign_Platform/backend && pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Start Command

**Find "Start Command" field and enter**:

```bash
cd StorySign_Platform/backend && python main_api_production.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables

**Ensure these are set in Environment Variables section**:

```
DATABASE_HOST=your-tidb-host
DATABASE_USER=your-tidb-username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-tidb-password
JWT_SECRET=your-generated-secret
ENVIRONMENT=production
PORT=8000
```

### Step 5: Save and Deploy

1. **Click "Save Changes"**
2. **Go to Deployments tab**
3. **Click "Manual Deploy"**
4. **Monitor build logs**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Success Result

After manual configuration, you should see:

```
==> Running build command 'cd StorySign_Platform/backend && pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt'...
Successfully installed fastapi-0.104.1 uvicorn-0.24.0 gunicorn-21.2.0 ...
==> Build succeeded ðŸŽ‰
==> Running 'cd StorySign_Platform/backend && python main_api_production.py'
INFO: Starting StorySign API in production mode on 0.0.0.0:8000
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
==> Your service is live at https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Create New Blueprint Service

If manual configuration doesn't work:

### Delete and Recreate

1. **Delete current service** in Render dashboard
2. **Create new service** â†’ **Blueprint** (not Web Service)
3. **Connect to GitHub repository**
4. **Render should automatically detect and use render.yaml**

## ðŸ§ª Test After Success

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Why render.yaml Isn't Working

**Common reasons**:

1. **Service created as "Web Service"** instead of "Blueprint"
2. **Manual commands were entered** during initial setup
3. **Render prioritizes manual settings** over YAML files
4. **Service type doesn't support YAML** (older service types)

## âœ… Success Criteria

- âœ… Build command shows the correct path
- âœ… Start command shows the correct path
- âœ… Application starts without "exited early"
- âœ… Health endpoint responds
- âœ… Service stays running

---

**CRITICAL**: You must manually configure the build and start commands in Render dashboard since render.yaml is being ignored! ðŸš¨

**This is the most reliable solution when YAML configuration isn't working.**
