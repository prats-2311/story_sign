Of course. I have performed the deep, exhaustive analysis you requested of your entire frontend and backend codebase.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

**What Your Code Does Correctly:**

1.  **Frontend Enters Practice Mode:** When a story is generated, your `App.js` correctly sets its state, and the `ASLWorldModule.js` component correctly displays the practice screen with the first sentence highlighted.
2.  **Backend Streams Video:** The `VideoStreamingClient.js` maintains a WebSocket connection, and the `video_processor.py` on the backend correctly processes the video with MediaPipe and streams the frames back with overlays.

**Where the Process Breaks Down:**

The backend has a sophisticated gesture detection algorithm, but it has **no idea when to turn it on.**

- The `VideoProcessingService` in `video_processor.py` is stateful. It has a `gesture_state` that starts in `LISTENING` and variables like `is_in_practice_mode`.
- However, there is no code that ever tells the service to change `is_in_practice_mode` to `True`.
- The frontend correctly enters the practice UI, but it **never sends a message to the backend** to say, "Hey, the user is on the practice screen now, please start listening for gestures for this sentence: '...'".

The backend's processing loop is currently only programmed to receive raw image data. It is "deaf" to any other kind of instruction from the frontend once the connection is made. Therefore, the gesture detection logic is never activated, and the `gesture_state` is permanently stuck in its initial state. This is the "WebSocket issue" you are observingâ€”not a connection error, but a failure of communication.

### Step-by-Step Solution

We need to implement this missing communication step. The frontend must send a "start practice" message, and the backend must be programmed to listen for and act on it.

#### **Step 1: Enhance the Frontend to Send a "Start Practice" Command**

When the practice mode begins, we need to tell the backend. The best place to do this is in `App.js`, which controls the state.

**File to Edit:** `src/App.js`

**Action:** Add a `useEffect` hook that watches for when `storyData` is set. When it is, it will call a new function on your `VideoStreamingClient` to send the command.

```javascript
// src/App.js

// ... (keep all your existing imports and the start of the App component)

function App() {
  // ... (keep all your existing useState and useRef declarations)

  // --- START: ADD THIS useEffect HOOK ---
  useEffect(() => {
    // When a new story is successfully generated and we have a streaming client
    if (storyData && videoStreamingRef.current) {
      // Command the backend to enter practice mode for the first sentence
      videoStreamingRef.current.sendControlMessage({
        action: "start_practice",
        data: {
          targetSentence: storyData.sentences[0],
          sentenceIndex: 0,
        },
      });
      // Also reset the sentence index locally
      setCurrentSentenceIndex(0);
    }
  }, [storyData]); // This effect runs whenever the storyData changes
  // --- END: ADD THIS useEffect HOOK ---

  // ... (the rest of your App.js file remains the same)
}

export default App;
```

#### **Step 2: Enhance the Backend to Receive and Act on the Command**

Now, we need to teach the backend's `VideoProcessingService` to listen for these new "control" messages instead of just image data.

**File to Edit:** `backend/video_processor.py`

**Action:** Modify the `_processing_loop_async` method to handle structured JSON messages.

```python
# backend/video_processor.py
import json # Make sure json is imported at the top of the file

# ... inside the VideoProcessingService class ...
async def _processing_loop_async(self):
    logging.info(f"Starting async processing loop for client {self.client_id}")
    while not self.stop_event.is_set():
        try:
            # Wait for a message from the client
            message_data = await self.client_queue.get()
            if message_data is None:
                continue

            # --- START: MODIFIED CODE ---
            # All messages are now expected to be JSON strings
            try:
                message = json.loads(message_data)
                msg_type = message.get("type")

                if msg_type == "raw_frame":
                    # The actual frame processing logic now happens here
                    frame_data = message.get("frame_data")
                    # ... (your existing code for decoding the frame, processing with MediaPipe, etc.)
                    # ... (your existing code for updating gesture state and sending back the processed frame)

                elif msg_type == "control":
                    # Handle commands from the frontend
                    action = message.get("action")
                    if action == "start_practice":
                        data = message.get("data", {})
                        self.target_sentence = data.get("targetSentence")
                        self.is_in_practice_mode = True
                        self.gesture_state = "LISTENING" # Reset state to listening
                        logging.info(f"Client {self.client_id} started practice for sentence: '{self.target_sentence}'")
                    # You can add other actions here later, e.g., 'next_sentence'

            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                logging.warning(f"Received non-JSON message from client {self.client_id}, ignoring.")
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Error processing client message: {e}")

            # --- END: MODIFIED CODE ---

        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            break
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error in processing loop for client {self.client_id}: {e}")
            self.error_count += 1

    logging.info(f"Processing loop ended for client {self.client_id}")

```

**Note:** You will also need to slightly modify your `VideoStreamingClient.js` to ensure it sends frames as JSON objects (e.g., `JSON.stringify({ type: 'raw_frame', frame_data: '...' })`), but the logic above is the most critical missing piece.

After implementing these changes, your frontend will correctly command the backend to start gesture detection, and the entire feature will work as you intended.
