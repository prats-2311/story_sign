# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign frontend application is experiencing several critical issues related to Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration, service worker functionality, and manifest file handling. These issues are causing console errors, failed resource loading, and degraded user experience. This specification addresses the systematic resolution of these frontend infrastructure problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without console errors, so that I have a smooth and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the console SHALL NOT display manifest.json preload errors
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all required icons SHALL be available and properly configured
3. WHEN the service worker initializes THEN it SHALL NOT throw permission or resource errors
4. WHEN PWA features are accessed THEN they SHALL function without throwing exceptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want PWA features to work correctly, so that I can use the application offline and receive proper notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service worker registers THEN it SHALL complete successfully without permission errors
2. WHEN background sync is attempted THEN it SHALL either succeed or fail gracefully with proper error handling
3. WHEN the application is used offline THEN cached resources SHALL be served correctly
4. WHEN PWA installation is triggered THEN all required manifest properties SHALL be present and valid

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for PWA features, so that failures don't impact the core application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PWA features fail THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN service worker registration fails THEN appropriate fallback behavior SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN background sync is not supported THEN the application SHALL handle this gracefully
4. WHEN manifest resources are missing THEN proper default values SHALL be provided

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle cross-origin resources properly, so that all features work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external resources are loaded THEN proper CORS headers SHALL be configured
2. WHEN manifest.json is accessed THEN crossorigin attributes SHALL be properly set
3. WHEN service worker scripts are loaded THEN they SHALL have appropriate permissions
4. WHEN PWA features interact with external services THEN security policies SHALL be respected
