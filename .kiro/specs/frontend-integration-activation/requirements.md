# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign frontend refactoring is complete with all new components, hooks, pages, and contexts built. This specification covers the final integration steps required to activate the new modular, authenticated architecture by switching the application's entry point from the old monolithic view to the new system. The integration involves setting up global authentication state, implementing the new application router, and ensuring the complete workflow functions correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up global authentication state throughout the application, so that user login status and profile information are available to all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL wrap the entire App component with AuthProvider in src/index.js
2. WHEN AuthProvider is initialized THEN the system SHALL make authentication context available to all child components
3. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL propagate updates throughout the component tree
4. WHEN components need authentication data THEN the system SHALL provide access through the useAuth hook

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a complete routing system with authentication protection, so that I can access appropriate pages based on my login status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the login page
2. WHEN I try to access protected routes without login THEN the system SHALL redirect me to /login
3. WHEN I successfully log in THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the dashboard page
4. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow access to ASL World, Harmony, and Reconnect modules
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator while checking authentication state
6. WHEN routing is configured THEN the system SHALL use React Router with proper route protection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to the new modular pages within a consistent shell interface, so that I have a cohesive navigation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access protected routes THEN the system SHALL wrap content in the PlatformShell component
2. WHEN I navigate between modules THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header navigation
3. WHEN I click navigation links THEN the system SHALL route to ASL World, Harmony, Reconnect, and Dashboard pages
4. WHEN the shell loads THEN the system SHALL provide consistent styling and accessibility features
5. WHEN I use the application THEN the system SHALL apply global CSS including accessibility and responsive styles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login and registration functionality to work seamlessly, so that I can create accounts and access the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit /login THEN the system SHALL display the new LoginPage component
2. WHEN I visit /register THEN the system SHALL display the new RegisterPage component
3. WHEN I submit login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
4. WHEN I create a new account THEN the system SHALL register the user and allow login
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN I am already logged in THEN the system SHALL redirect away from login/register pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the complete application workflow, so that I can ensure all integration steps work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend starts THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect unauthenticated users to /login
2. WHEN I manually navigate to protected routes while unauthenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
3. WHEN I complete registration THEN the system SHALL allow immediate login with new credentials
4. WHEN I log in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard showing the new interface
5. WHEN I use header navigation THEN the system SHALL successfully route to ASL World with the new Story Setup component
6. WHEN I test the complete workflow THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the new design and modular structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain performance and reliability during the integration, so that the user experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL complete initialization within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN routing occurs THEN the system SHALL transition between pages without errors or delays
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI responsively
4. WHEN the new architecture is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user experience
6. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready for production deployment
