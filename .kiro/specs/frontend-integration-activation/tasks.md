# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up global authentication context at root level

  - Modify `src/index.js` to import and wrap App component with AuthProvider
  - Ensure AuthProvider is positioned correctly in the component hierarchy above BrowserRouter
  - Test that authentication context is available throughout the application
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Create new application router structure in App.js

  - Replace existing App.js content with new routing logic that separates public and protected routes
  - Implement AppContent component that handles routing after authentication state is determined
  - Add loading state display while AuthContext checks for stored authentication tokens
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 5.1_

- [x] 3. Implement public route configuration

  - Configure `/login` route to render LoginPage component without authentication requirement
  - Configure `/register` route to render RegisterPage component without authentication requirement
  - Ensure public routes are accessible regardless of authentication state
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Set up protected route wrapper with nested routing

  - Create protected route wrapper that combines ProtectedRoute and PlatformShell components
  - Implement nested Routes component within the protected wrapper for authenticated pages
  - Configure catch-all route pattern (`/*`) to handle all protected application areas
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Configure protected module routes

  - Set up `/dashboard` route to render MainDashboard component within PlatformShell
  - Configure `/asl-world` route to render ASLWorldPage component with new Story Setup interface
  - Add `/harmony` route to render HarmonyPage component for facial expression practice
  - Add `/reconnect` route to render ReconnectPage component for movement analysis
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement default navigation and redirects

  - Configure root path (`/`) to redirect authenticated users to `/dashboard`
  - Set up automatic redirect to `/login` for unauthenticated users accessing protected routes
  - Implement proper redirect logic that maintains intended destination after login
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Add global CSS imports and styling

  - Import `./App.css`, `./styles/accessibility.css`, and `./styles/responsive.css` in App.js
  - Ensure consistent styling is applied across all routes within PlatformShell
  - Verify responsive design works correctly with new routing structure
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement authentication error handling

  - Add error handling for authentication failures during login and registration
  - Implement proper error display for invalid credentials or registration issues
  - Add retry mechanisms and user feedback for authentication errors
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Test complete authentication workflow

  - Verify unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` when accessing root path
  - Test that manual navigation to protected routes redirects to login page
  - Confirm successful login redirects to dashboard page with new interface
  - Test registration workflow creates accounts and allows immediate login
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Verify navigation and module integration

  - Test header navigation links route correctly to ASL World, Harmony, and Reconnect modules
  - Confirm ASL World page displays new Story Setup component after integration
  - Verify all modules load within consistent PlatformShell interface
  - Test navigation maintains authentication state across route changes
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 3.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 11. Implement performance optimizations

  - Ensure route transitions complete within acceptable time limits
  - Optimize loading states to provide responsive user feedback
  - Test application performance with new routing structure under normal usage
  - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended navigation sessions
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 12. Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks
  - Implement error boundaries for component loading failures
  - Add fallback UI for failed route component loads
  - Ensure graceful handling of network errors during authentication
  - Test error recovery mechanisms work correctly
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 6.6_
