# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign Database & Modularity Enhancement extends the existing ASL Platform with persistent data storage, user management, and a modular plugin architecture. This enhancement transforms the current single-session application into a comprehensive learning management system that tracks user progress, manages content libraries, provides analytics insights, and supports extensible functionality through a plugin system. The system will maintain backward compatibility with the existing real-time video processing while adding robust data persistence and multi-user capabilities.

6. WHEN I install a new plugin THEN the system SHALL validate its compatibility and security before activation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to analyze learning patterns and performance data, so that I can improve ASL teaching methods and platform effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive learning metrics across all users (anonymized)
2. WHEN I query performance data THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by time period, user demographics, story difficulty, and learning outcomes
3. WHEN I export research data THEN the system SHALL provide anonymized datasets in standard research formats
4. WHEN users consent to research participation THEN the system SHALL collect detailed interaction data while protecting privacy
5. WHEN I analyze gesture patterns THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated data on common signing errors and improvement areas
6. IF users opt out of research THEN the system SHALL exclude their data from all research queries and exports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data management and backup capabilities, so that user progress and content are never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL automatically backup all user data and content to secure storage locations
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically restore from the most recent valid backup
3. WHEN I perform maintenance THEN the system SHALL provide tools for database migration, cleanup, and optimization
4. WHEN users delete their accounts THEN the system SHALL securely remove all personal data while preserving anonymized research data (if consented)
5. WHEN I monitor system health THEN the system SHALL provide alerts for storage capacity, backup failures, and performance issues
6. WHEN I need to scale the system THEN the database architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling and load distribution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to collaborate with other learners, so that I can practice together and learn from each other's progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to practice with others THEN the system SHALL allow me to create or join collaborative practice sessions
2. WHEN I'm in a group session THEN the system SHALL synchronize story content and allow multiple users to practice simultaneously
