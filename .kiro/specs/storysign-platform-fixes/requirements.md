# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign platform currently has two critical user experience issues that need to be resolved: users must manually click a "Test Backend" button to establish backend connectivity before using features like story generation, and there is no logout functionality available in the user interface. This specification addresses these issues by implementing automatic backend connection and complete logout functionality to improve the overall user experience and platform usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to automatically connect to the backend when the application starts, so that I can use story generation and other features immediately without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the frontend SHALL automatically connect to the backend API at http://127.0.0.1:8000
2. WHEN the frontend initializes THEN it SHALL use the backend URL as the default API endpoint without requiring user action
3. WHEN I navigate to ASL World THEN the "Scan Object to Start" functionality SHALL work immediately without clicking "Test Backend"
4. WHEN the backend connection is established THEN the "Test Backend" button SHALL be removed from the user interface
5. WHEN the application loads THEN story generation and other backend-dependent features SHALL be immediately available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log out of the application, so that I can securely end my session and protect my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am logged in THEN the system SHALL display a "Logout" button in the user menu dropdown
2. WHEN I click the logout button THEN the system SHALL clear my authentication token from localStorage
3. WHEN I logout THEN the system SHALL reset my user state to unauthenticated
4. WHEN logout is triggered THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the login page
5. WHEN I am logged out THEN I SHALL NOT have access to protected routes without re-authenticating
6. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN it SHALL include a logout icon for clear visual identification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API configuration to be centralized and consistent, so that backend connectivity is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API configuration is updated THEN it SHALL export the backend URL directly without conditional logic
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the configured backend endpoint consistently
3. WHEN the backend server is running THEN the frontend SHALL connect automatically without user intervention
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL use the standardized base URL configuration
5. WHEN the configuration changes THEN it SHALL not require modifications to individual components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication context to provide complete session management, so that login and logout operations work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthContext is initialized THEN it SHALL provide login, register, and logout functions
2. WHEN logout is called THEN the AuthContext SHALL handle all cleanup operations automatically
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL receive updated context values
4. WHEN logout completes THEN the user SHALL be redirected using React Router navigation
5. WHEN the authentication context is used THEN it SHALL provide consistent behavior across all components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform shell to include proper logout functionality, so that I have easy access to session management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the platform header THEN the user menu SHALL include profile, settings, and logout options
2. WHEN I click the user menu THEN it SHALL display a dropdown with properly styled logout button
3. WHEN the logout button is rendered THEN it SHALL include the LogOut icon from lucide-react
4. WHEN I interact with the logout button THEN it SHALL trigger the logout function from AuthContext
5. WHEN the user menu is displayed THEN it SHALL show my username or "Guest" appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that both fixes work correctly, so that the platform provides a seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both frontend and backend servers are running THEN story generation SHALL work immediately upon application launch
2. WHEN I test the complete authentication flow THEN login and logout SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN I logout and attempt to access protected routes THEN I SHALL be redirected to login
4. WHEN the backend connection is automatic THEN no manual "Test Backend" action SHALL be required
5. WHEN I verify the fixes THEN both automatic connection and logout functionality SHALL be fully operational
6. WHEN the application is used end-to-end THEN the user experience SHALL be smooth and intuitive
