# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StorySign ASL Platform is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and learning system that combines computer vision, web technologies, and interactive user interfaces. The platform enables users to practice ASL through live video feedback with MediaPipe-powered hand, face, and body tracking overlaid on their webcam feed. The system consists of a React/Electron frontend application that communicates with a FastAPI backend server, which processes live video streams using MediaPipe for pose detection and landmark tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my live webcam feed with ASL tracking overlays, so that I can practice sign language with real-time visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a live webcam feed in the user interface
2. WHEN MediaPipe processes each video frame THEN the system SHALL overlay hand landmarks on the video feed
3. WHEN MediaPipe processes each video frame THEN the system SHALL overlay face landmarks on the video feed
4. WHEN MediaPipe processes each video frame THEN the system SHALL overlay body pose landmarks on the video feed
5. WHEN the video stream is active THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance with minimal latency
6. IF the webcam is not available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive desktop application interface, so that I can easily interact with the StorySign platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a desktop window with the title "StorySign"
2. WHEN the main interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide a "Test Backend" button for connectivity verification
3. WHEN the main interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated area for displaying video content
4. WHEN the main interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide a message display area for system feedback
5. WHEN the user clicks the "Test Backend" button THEN the system SHALL verify backend connectivity and display the result

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust backend API system, so that the frontend can reliably communicate with the video processing services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the system SHALL expose a REST API endpoint at the root path ("/")
2. WHEN a GET request is made to the root endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with a welcome message
3. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the system SHALL expose a WebSocket endpoint for video streaming ("/ws/video")
4. WHEN a client connects to the video WebSocket THEN the system SHALL establish a persistent connection for real-time data transfer
5. IF the backend server encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and maintain stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time video processing and streaming, so that I can see immediate feedback on my sign language practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL begin capturing frames from the default webcam
2. WHEN each frame is captured THEN the system SHALL process it through MediaPipe Holistic model for landmark detection
3. WHEN landmarks are detected THEN the system SHALL draw visual overlays on the processed frame
4. WHEN frame processing is complete THEN the system SHALL encode the frame as base64 JPEG format
5. WHEN the encoded frame is ready THEN the system SHALL stream it to connected WebSocket clients
6. WHEN the frontend receives frame data THEN the system SHALL display it in the video component with minimal delay

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured project architecture, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL organize code into separate frontend and backend directories
2. WHEN the backend is developed THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI framework with proper dependency management
3. WHEN the frontend is developed THEN the system SHALL use React with Electron for desktop application capabilities
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use conda environment for Python packages
5. WHEN the code is written THEN the system SHALL include appropriate comments and documentation
6. IF new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain the established architectural patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable error handling and feedback, so that I understand when something goes wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server fails to start THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the terminal
2. WHEN the webcam cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL notify the user with an appropriate message
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN MediaPipe processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without crashing
5. WHEN the frontend cannot connect to the backend THEN the system SHALL display a connection error message
6. IF any component encounters an unexpected error THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
