# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign Platform Refactor represents a comprehensive architectural overhaul and expansion of the existing StorySign ASL learning platform. This refactor aims to enhance stability, dramatically improve UI/UX and accessibility, establish scalable architecture for new modules (Harmony and Reconnect), and prepare the platform for cloud deployment on Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend). The refactor addresses critical technical debt, implements modern React patterns, and expands the platform's capabilities beyond ASL learning into social-emotional learning and therapeutic movement analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized webcam and state management through React hooks, so that I can eliminate the "black screen" webcam bug and create a reliable foundation for all video-based features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs webcam access THEN the system SHALL use a centralized `useWebcam` hook
2. WHEN the `useWebcam` hook is called THEN the system SHALL properly manage `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` calls
3. WHEN a component unmounts or webcam access is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL execute proper cleanup logic with `stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop())`
4. WHEN multiple components need webcam access THEN the system SHALL prevent resource conflicts through a single source of truth
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use a centralized `useWebSocket` hook for connection lifecycle management
6. WHEN the legacy `VideoStream.js` file exists THEN the system SHALL remove it as part of the refactoring process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a complete authentication system with login and registration, so that I can securely access the platform and have my progress tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the platform THEN the system SHALL present accessible login and registration forms
2. WHEN I submit login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate against the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint
3. WHEN I submit registration information THEN the system SHALL create an account via the `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint
4. WHEN I successfully authenticate THEN the system SHALL store my JWT token and user profile in a global AuthContext
5. WHEN I try to access protected pages without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the login page
6. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow seamless access to all learning modules
7. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper labels, input types, and validation feedback for accessibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to work reliably in cloud environments, so that I can access it from anywhere without local dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed on Render THEN the system SHALL use cloud-based Groq API instead of local LM Studio
2. WHEN the Groq API is configured THEN the system SHALL load the API key from environment variables securely
3. WHEN the "Scan Object" feature is used THEN the system SHALL send captured frames to the cloud-deployed backend
4. WHEN the backend receives image data THEN the system SHALL forward it to Groq API with proper authorization headers
5. WHEN the frontend is deployed on Netlify THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for backend API URLs
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use relative paths that work with Netlify proxy configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved ASL World interface with better accessibility and user experience, so that I can learn more effectively and enjoyably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ASL World module loads THEN the system SHALL present a clean, step-by-step interface
2. WHEN I interact with any UI element THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation and screen readers
3. WHEN I progress through the learning flow THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of my current state
4. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
5. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL use React hooks for state management instead of class components
6. WHEN I use the video display THEN the system SHALL show a reusable, accessible VideoDisplayPanel component

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interested in social-emotional learning, I want a Harmony module for practicing facial expressions, so that I can improve my non-verbal communication skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Harmony module THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated page for facial expression practice
2. WHEN I use my webcam in Harmony mode THEN the system SHALL analyze facial landmarks using MediaPipe
3. WHEN my facial expressions are detected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on emotional cues
4. WHEN I complete Harmony sessions THEN the system SHALL store my progress in the database
5. WHEN the Harmony backend processes data THEN the system SHALL use dedicated API endpoints and services
6. WHEN I navigate to Harmony THEN the system SHALL reuse the centralized webcam and video display components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user seeking physical rehabilitation, I want a Reconnect module for therapeutic movement analysis, so that I can track my physical therapy progress with quantitative feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Reconnect module THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated page for movement analysis
2. WHEN I perform exercises THEN the system SHALL analyze full-body pose landmarks using MediaPipe
3. WHEN my movements are tracked THEN the system SHALL calculate metrics like joint angles and range of motion
4. WHEN exercise data is processed THEN the system SHALL display quantitative feedback through graphs and charts
5. WHEN I complete Reconnect sessions THEN the system SHALL store therapeutic progress data in the database
6. WHEN the Reconnect backend processes data THEN the system SHALL use dedicated API endpoints and services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a production-ready deployment configuration, so that the platform can be reliably hosted on Netlify and Render with proper CI/CD.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed on Render THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all secrets and configuration
2. WHEN the backend starts in production THEN the system SHALL use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for optimal performance
3. WHEN the frontend is built for production THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API endpoints
4. WHEN the frontend is deployed on Netlify THEN the system SHALL use proxy redirects to avoid CORS issues
5. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger builds and deployments
6. WHEN deployment configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL use `render.yaml` and `netlify.toml` files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the entire platform to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any interactive element is rendered THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation
2. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper labels and error messaging
3. WHEN dynamic content updates THEN the system SHALL announce changes to screen readers

5. WHEN the platform is tested THEN the system SHALL pass automated accessibility audits using tools like Axe
6. WHEN manual testing is performed THEN the system SHALL work correctly with screen readers

### Requirement 9

2. WHEN shared functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL provide reusable hooks and components
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for consistency
4. WHEN the codebase grows THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data access
5. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL include appropriate documentation and comments
6. WHEN the architecture is evaluated THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of new learning modules
