# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StorySign platform is experiencing critical video and camera functionality issues that are impacting the core user experience across multiple modules. Two primary bugs have been identified: (1) video streams disappearing after story generation in the ASL World module due to state management issues, and (2) inactive cameras in the Harmony and Reconnect modules due to missing webcam initialization. These issues prevent users from accessing the platform's core computer vision and MediaPipe-based ASL learning features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user practicing ASL in the ASL World module, I want the video stream to persist throughout my entire practice session, so that I can receive continuous visual feedback and gesture analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate a story in ASL World THEN the video stream SHALL remain active during the transition to practice mode
2. WHEN I switch from StorySetup to PracticeView THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL persist without interruption
3. WHEN the ASLWorldModule re-renders THEN the webcam state SHALL not be reset or lost
4. WHEN I am in practice mode THEN the ProcessedVideoDisplay component SHALL continuously show the MediaPipe-processed video stream
5. WHEN state changes occur within ASL World THEN the video processing SHALL maintain <100ms latency as per architecture requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want webcam and WebSocket state to be managed at the appropriate component level, so that state persistence is maintained across view transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ASLWorldPage component mounts THEN it SHALL initialize useWebSocket and useWebcam hooks at the page level
2. WHEN state is lifted to ASLWorldPage THEN it SHALL pass webcam and WebSocket props down to ASLWorldModule
3. WHEN ASLWorldModule receives props THEN it SHALL remove local state management for webcam and WebSocket
4. WHEN props are passed down THEN StorySetup and PracticeView components SHALL receive the necessary webcam and connection state
5. WHEN the component hierarchy is updated THEN the video stream SHALL remain connected to main_api_production.py WebSocket endpoint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing the Harmony module, I want my camera to activate automatically, so that I can practice facial expressions and social-emotional learning features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Harmony page THEN the system SHALL automatically request camera access
2. WHEN the HarmonyPage component mounts THEN it SHALL call startWebcam() via useWebcam hook
3. WHEN the camera is active THEN the HarmonyModule SHALL be rendered with webcam access
4. WHEN the camera is inactive THEN a clear message SHALL be displayed requesting permission
5. WHEN I leave the Harmony page THEN the system SHALL properly clean up camera resources by calling stopWebcam()

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user accessing the Reconnect module, I want my camera to activate automatically, so that I can practice therapeutic movement analysis and physical rehabilitation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Reconnect page THEN the system SHALL automatically request camera access
2. WHEN the ReconnectPage component mounts THEN it SHALL call startWebcam() via useWebcam hook
3. WHEN the camera is active THEN the ReconnectModule SHALL be rendered with webcam access
4. WHEN the camera is inactive THEN a clear message SHALL be displayed requesting permission
5. WHEN I leave the Reconnect page THEN the system SHALL properly clean up camera resources by calling stopWebcam()

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent camera management across all modules, so that I have a predictable experience when using video-based features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page with camera features loads THEN the useWebcam hook SHALL be initialized consistently
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN all modules SHALL have access to the same webcam stream
3. WHEN I switch between modules THEN camera resources SHALL be properly managed to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN camera errors occur THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to guide user action
5. WHEN the application uses cameras THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with main_api_production.py for both local and production environments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the video and camera fixes to maintain the existing MediaPipe integration, so that gesture detection and computer vision features continue to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video streams are fixed THEN MediaPipe processing SHALL continue to function with the same performance characteristics
2. WHEN WebSocket connections persist THEN real-time video streaming SHALL maintain the existing frame throttling and latency optimization
3. WHEN camera initialization is added THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing gesture detection algorithms
4. WHEN the fixes are implemented THEN the ProcessedVideoDisplay component SHALL continue to render MediaPipe landmarks and annotations
5. WHEN the system processes video THEN it SHALL maintain async processing patterns to avoid blocking the event loop

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video and camera functionality to work reliably in both development and production environments, so that I can use the platform consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs locally THEN video and camera features SHALL work with main_api_production.py
2. WHEN the application is deployed to production THEN the same main_api_production.py SHALL handle video processing
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL connect to the correct endpoint regardless of environment
4. WHEN camera permissions are requested THEN they SHALL work across different browsers and devices
5. WHEN the fixes are deployed THEN existing user workflows SHALL not be disrupted
