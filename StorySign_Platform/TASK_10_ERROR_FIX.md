# Task 10 Error Fix: Function Declaration Order Issue

## Problem

The browser console was showing the following error:

```
ProcessedVideoDisplay.js:167 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'drawOverlayInfo' before initialization
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by incorrect function declaration order in the `ProcessedVideoDisplay.js` component. The functions were being used before they were defined:

1. `renderFrameToCanvas` was trying to use `drawOverlayInfo` before it was declared
2. `drawOverlayInfo` was trying to use `getConnectionQualityColor` before it was declared

## Solution

Reordered the function declarations in the correct dependency order:

1. **First**: `getConnectionQualityColor` - No dependencies
2. **Second**: `drawOverlayInfo` - Depends on `getConnectionQualityColor`
3. **Third**: `renderFrameToCanvas` - Depends on `drawOverlayInfo`

## Changes Made

In `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/ProcessedVideoDisplay.js`:

- Moved `getConnectionQualityColor` function declaration before `drawOverlayInfo`
- Moved `drawOverlayInfo` function declaration before `renderFrameToCanvas`
- Maintained all existing functionality and dependencies

## Verification

- ✅ Build now compiles successfully with no errors or warnings
- ✅ All 8/8 Task 10 verification tests still pass
- ✅ Component functionality remains intact
- ✅ Browser console error resolved

## Status

**FIXED** - The ProcessedVideoDisplay component now works correctly without any runtime errors.
