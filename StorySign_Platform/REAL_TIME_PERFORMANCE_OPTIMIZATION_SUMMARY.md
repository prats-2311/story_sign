## Integration Points

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Endpoint (`api/websocket.py`)

The main WebSocket endpoint has been completely rewritten to use the new optimized systems:

```python
@router.websocket("/ws/video")
async def websocket_video_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    # Uses connection pool for efficient connection management
    # Routes messages through optimized processors
    # Integrates with adaptive quality management
```

**Key Improvements**:

- Connection pooling integration
- Message routing optimization
- Adaptive quality integration
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance monitoring

### 2. Optimization API Endpoints (`api/optimization.py`)

Extended the existing optimization API with real-time performance monitoring:

**New Endpoints**:

- `/optimization/realtime/stats` - Real-time performance statistics
- `/optimization/websocket/pool/stats` - Connection pool metrics
- `/optimization/websocket/clients` - Connected client information
- `/optimization/queues/stats` - Message queue statistics
- `/optimization/adaptive-quality/stats` - Quality management metrics

### 3. Configuration Integration

The optimizations integrate with the existing configuration system:

```python
# Video processing configuration
video_config = config.video
mediapipe_config = config.mediapipe
gesture_config = config.gesture_detection

# Optimization settings
max_connections = 1000
queue_size = 10000
batch_size = 10
```
