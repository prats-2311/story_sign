### Database Schema

#### Key Tables

- `assignments`: Assignment configuration and metadata
- `assignment_submissions`: Student submission tracking
- `notifications`: System notifications with scheduling
- `group_messages`: Group communication and announcements
- `notification_preferences`: User notification settings

#### Relationships

- Assignments belong to groups and are created by educators
- Submissions link assignments to students with performance data
- Notifications can reference assignments, groups, and sessions
- Messages support threading and reactions

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
