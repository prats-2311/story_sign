# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records for the StorySign Platform. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, decision, and consequences.

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision

[Describe the decision made]

## Consequences

[Describe the positive and negative consequences]

## Alternatives Considered

[List alternatives that were considered]

## References

[Links to relevant documentation or discussions]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Number ADRs sequentially** starting from 001
2. **Use descriptive titles** that clearly indicate the decision
3. **Keep ADRs focused** on a single architectural decision
4. **Update status** when decisions are superseded or deprecated
5. **Include rationale** for why the decision was made
6. **Document consequences** both positive and negative
