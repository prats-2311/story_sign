# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The StorySign platform requires a modern, accessible frontend framework that can handle real-time video processing, WebSocket connections, and complex user interactions. The framework must support:

- Real-time webcam integration
- WebSocket communication for live video streaming
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Desktop application support via Electron
- Component reusability across multiple learning modules

## Decision

We have chosen **React 18 with Hooks** as the primary frontend framework.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Mature Ecosystem**: Large community, extensive documentation, and proven track record
- **Hooks Architecture**: Modern functional component approach with better state management
- **Accessibility Support**: Excellent tooling and libraries for accessibility compliance
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Strong WebSocket and media stream support
- **PWA Support**: Good service worker integration and offline capabilities
- **Electron Compatibility**: Well-established React-Electron integration patterns
- **Testing Ecosystem**: Comprehensive testing tools (Jest, React Testing Library, Axe)
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and React 18's concurrent features for smooth video processing

### Negative

- **Bundle Size**: React adds overhead compared to lighter frameworks
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of React patterns and hooks
- **Rapid Changes**: React ecosystem evolves quickly, requiring ongoing updates

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js 3

- **Pros**: Smaller bundle size, gentler learning curve, good TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem for accessibility tools, less mature Electron integration

### Angular

- **Pros**: Full framework with built-in features, excellent TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, larger bundle size, overkill for our use case

### Svelte/SvelteKit

- **Pros**: Excellent performance, smaller bundle sizes, modern approach
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, fewer accessibility tools, less mature for complex applications

### Vanilla JavaScript

- **Pros**: No framework overhead, complete control
- **Cons**: Significant development time, manual accessibility implementation, complex state management

## Implementation Details

### Key React Features Used

- **Functional Components with Hooks**: Modern React patterns for cleaner code
- **Custom Hooks**: Centralized logic for webcam, WebSocket, and authentication
- **Context API**: Global state management without external dependencies
- **Suspense and Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for better performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for video processing failures

### Accessibility Integration

- **React Testing Library**: Testing with accessibility in mind
- **Axe-core**: Automated accessibility testing
- **ARIA Support**: Built-in support for ARIA attributes and roles
- **Focus Management**: React's ref system for keyboard navigation

### Development Tools

- **Create React App**: Standard build tooling with customizations
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation
- **React DevTools**: Debugging and performance profiling
