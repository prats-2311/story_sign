**Overall Status: 6/6 Requirements PASSED** ðŸŽ‰

## Implementation Verification

### 1. Automatic Backend Connection (Requirements 6.1, 6.4)

**âœ… Verified:**

- API configuration exports direct backend URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- No conditional logic in API configuration
- Simplified configuration for direct connection
- No "Test Backend" button in MainDashboard
- ASL World works immediately without manual backend setup

**Files Modified:**

- `src/config/api.js` - Simplified to direct URL export
- `src/pages/dashboard/MainDashboard.js` - Removed "Test Backend" button

### 2. Complete Logout Functionality (Requirements 6.2, 6.3)

**âœ… Verified:**

- AuthContext imports and uses `useNavigate` for routing
- Logout function includes navigation to login page
- localStorage cleanup handled through authService
- PlatformShell integrates with AuthContext using `useAuth` hook
- LogOut icon from lucide-react included in user menu
- Logout button triggers proper logout function

**Files Modified:**

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Enhanced with logout navigation
- `src/components/shell/PlatformShell.js` - Integrated with AuthContext logout

### 3. End-to-End Authentication Flow (Requirement 6.5)

**âœ… Verified:**

- AuthContext provides complete authentication state
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch/finally blocks
- Proper state management using useReducer

- Authentication state transitions work correctly

### 4. ASL World Immediate Functionality (Requirement 6.6)

**âœ… Verified:**

- MainDashboard indicates automatic backend connection
- Direct ASL World navigation without backend connection requirements
- No backend connection status dependencies
- Simplified component props without connection requirements
