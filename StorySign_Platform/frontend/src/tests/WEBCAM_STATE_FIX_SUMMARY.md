# Webcam State Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The ASL World page was showing "Camera is inactive" even when the webcam light was on and camera
access was granted. This was causing confusion for users who could see their camera was active but
the application wasn't detecting it.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the ASLWorldPage component where the webcam stream was being incorrectly
passed to the StorySetup component:

1. **Wrong prop type**: The `webcamRef` prop was being passed a MediaStream object instead of a
   video element reference
2. **Missing stream assignment**: The video element wasn't getting the webcam stream assigned to its
   `srcObject` property

## Code Changes Made

### 1. ASLWorldPage.js Changes

#### Added video element ref for StorySetup:

```javascript
// Video element ref for StorySetup component
const storySetupVideoRef = useRef(null);
```

#### Added effect to attach webcam stream:

```javascript
// Effect to attach webcam stream to video element for StorySetup
useEffect(() => {
  if (webcamStream && storySetupVideoRef.current) {
    storySetupVideoRef.current.srcObject = webcamStream;
    const playPromise = storySetupVideoRef.current.play();
    if (playPromise && typeof playPromise.catch === "function") {
      playPromise.catch(error => {
        console.warn("Video autoplay failed:", error);
      });
    }
  }
}, [webcamStream]);
```

#### Fixed prop passing to StorySetup:

```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
webcamRef = { webcamStream }; // Pass the actual webcam stream

// After (correct):
webcamRef = { storySetupVideoRef }; // Pass video element ref
webcamStream = { webcamStream }; // Pass the actual webcam stream
```

### 2. StorySetup.js Changes

#### Added webcamStream prop:

```javascript
const StorySetup = ({
  // ... other props
  webcamRef = null,
  webcamStream = null, // New prop
  // ... rest of props
}) => {
```

#### Added effect to attach stream to video element:

```javascript
// Effect to attach webcam stream to video element
React.useEffect(() => {
  const videoElement = webcamRef?.current || videoRef.current;
  if (webcamStream && videoElement && isWebcamActive) {
    videoElement.srcObject = webcamStream;
    const playPromise = videoElement.play();
    if (playPromise && typeof playPromise.catch === "function") {
      playPromise.catch(error => {
        console.warn("Video autoplay failed:", error);
      });
    }
  }
}, [webcamStream, isWebcamActive, webcamRef]);
```

#### Updated captureFrame function:

```javascript
// Handle object scanning using parent's captureFrame function
const handleScanObject = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const videoElement = webcamRef?.current || videoRef.current;
    if (captureFrame && videoElement) {
      // Use parent's captureFrame function with video element
      const frameData = await captureFrame(videoElement);
      if (frameData && onStoryGenerate) {
        await onStoryGenerate({ frame_data: frameData.frameData });
      }
    } else {
      console.error("captureFrame function or video element not available");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error capturing frame for story generation:", error);
  }
}, [captureFrame, onStoryGenerate, webcamRef]);
```

## Technical Details

### The Problem

1. **MediaStream vs Video Element**: The original code was passing a MediaStream object as
   `webcamRef`, but the StorySetup component expected a video element reference.
2. **Missing Stream Assignment**: The video element never had its `srcObject` property set to the
   webcam stream, so it couldn't display the camera feed.
3. **State Mismatch**: The `isWebcamActive` state was correctly detecting the camera, but the UI
   wasn't showing the video feed.

### The Solution

1. **Proper Prop Types**: Pass the video element ref as `webcamRef` and the stream as `webcamStream`
2. **Stream Assignment**: Use useEffect to properly assign the webcam stream to the video element's
   `srcObject`
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling for video play() method that might not return a
   Promise in test environments

## Testing

- Added test file `webcam-fix.test.js` to verify the fix works correctly
- Tests check that camera state is properly detected and video elements are created
- Error handling ensures compatibility with test environments where video.play() might not return a
  Promise

## Impact

- ✅ Camera state now properly reflects when webcam is active
- ✅ Video feed displays correctly in the StorySetup component
- ✅ Object scanning functionality works with proper video element reference
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing props
- ✅ Improved error handling for edge cases

## Files Modified

1. `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/pages/ASLWorldPage.js`
2. `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/modules/asl_world/StorySetup.js`
3. `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/tests/webcam-fix.test.js` (new test file)
4. `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/tests/WEBCAM_STATE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Verification Steps

1. Open ASL World page
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Verify that camera feed appears in the "Scan Object" tab
4. Verify that "Camera is inactive" message no longer appears when camera is working
5. Test object scanning functionality works correctly
