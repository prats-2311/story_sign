# Duplicate Import Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the `SyntaxError: Identifier 'useErrorRecovery' has already been declared` compilation error.

## Root Cause

When adding the missing React hook imports, they were accidentally placed in the wrong location
within the file, creating duplicate import statements:

- Line 30: `import { useErrorRecovery } from "./services/ErrorRecoveryService";` (correct location)
- Line 72: `import { useErrorRecovery } from "./services/ErrorRecoveryService";` (duplicate, wrong
  location)

## Fix Applied

1. **Removed duplicate imports** that were incorrectly placed in the middle of the class definition
2. **Kept the correct imports** at the top of the file with other imports
3. **Restored CSS imports** to their proper location

## Files Fixed

- `src/App.js` - Removed duplicate imports and reorganized import statements

## Final Import Structure

```javascript
// React and routing imports
import React, { useEffect, lazy, Suspense, useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { Routes, Route, Navigate, useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

// Component imports
import { PlatformShell } from "./components";
import { ProtectedRoute } from "./components/auth";
// ... other component imports

// Error boundary imports
import {
  EnhancedErrorFallback,
  NetworkErrorBoundary,
  AuthenticationErrorBoundary,
  ComponentLoadingErrorBoundary,
  RouteErrorBoundary,
} from "./components/error/ErrorBoundaries";

// Hook imports
import { useErrorRecovery } from "./services/ErrorRecoveryService";
import { useAuthErrorHandler } from "./utils/authErrorHandler";

// CSS imports
import "./App.css";
import "./styles/accessibility.css";
import "./styles/responsive.css";
import "./components/error/ErrorBoundaries.css";
```

## Verification

- ✅ No duplicate imports remain
- ✅ All imports are in correct locations
- ✅ CSS imports restored
- ✅ File structure is valid

## Result

The application should now compile successfully without syntax errors.
