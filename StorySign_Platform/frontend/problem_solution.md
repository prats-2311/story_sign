Of course. I have conducted a detailed and exhaustive analysis of all the files you provided for your full-stack StorySign application. This is an excellent and well-structured project that is very close to working.

The reason the MediaPipe skeleton is not visible is due to a single, critical missing piece in the frontend code. Let's break down the entire system, pinpoint the issue, and explain how to fix it.

### **1. High-Level System Architecture**

First, let's understand how your application is designed to work. You have correctly implemented a classic client-server architecture for real-time video processing:

- **Frontend (React):**

  - `WebcamCapture.js` accesses the user's camera and captures raw video frames.
  - `VideoStreamingClient.js` establishes a WebSocket connection to the backend. It sends the raw frames captured by `WebcamCapture.js` to the server.
  - `App.js` orchestrates everything, displaying the UI and managing the state of the webcam and the WebSocket connection.

- **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**

  - `main.py` runs the FastAPI server and provides a WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/video`.
  - When the frontend connects, the backend receives the raw video frames.
  - `video_processor.py` takes each raw frame, uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks, **draws the skeleton onto the frame**, and then sends the processed (annotated) frame back to the frontend over the same WebSocket.

The system is designed to be a loop: **React captures -\> Python processes and draws -\> React displays.**

### **2. The Root Cause of the Problem**

The MediaPipe skeleton is not visible because **the React frontend is not set up to display the processed video stream it receives from the backend.**

Let's trace the data flow to see exactly where the breakdown occurs:

1.  **Backend is Working Correctly:** Your Python code in `video_processor.py` is correctly processing the image. The function `process_frame` clearly shows that after landmarks are detected, `mp_drawing.draw_landmarks` is called. This means the skeleton **is being drawn** on the image on the server side before it's sent back.

2.  **Data is Being Sent Back:** The WebSocket endpoint in `main.py` is configured to send the processed frame back to the client.

3.  **Frontend Receives Data, But Not the Image:** This is the critical point. In `VideoStreamingClient.js`, the `onmessage` handler receives data from the backend. It correctly parses this data and calls the `onProcessedFrame` function.

4.  **The Missing Piece:** In `App.js`, the `handleProcessedFrame` function takes this data and stores it in a state variable called `processedFrameData`. **However, the application never uses this state to actually render an image.** You are displaying the _metadata_ (frame number, processing time), but you are not displaying the processed video frame itself.

The frontend has a component to _show_ the raw webcam feed (`WebcamCapture.js`), but it is missing a component or an `<img>` tag to _show_ the processed feed coming back from the server.

### **3. Detailed File Analysis & Evidence**

- **`backend/video_processor.py`:** This file is correct. It contains the essential `mp_drawing.draw_landmarks` call, which proves the skeleton is being added to the image on the server.

- **`App.js`:** This is where the issue lies. The `handleProcessedFrame` function is defined:

  ```javascript
  const handleProcessedFrame = (data) => {
    setProcessedFrameData(data);
  };
  ```

  And later, you display the metadata from this state:

  ```javascript
  {
    processedFrameData && (
      <div className="processed-frame-info">
        <h4>Latest Processed Frame</h4>
        <p>Frame #{processedFrameData.metadata?.frame_number}</p>
        {/* ... more metadata ... */}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  There is no `<img>` tag here to display the actual image data that the backend is sending.

- **`VideoStreamingClient.js`:** This component correctly establishes the WebSocket connection and receives messages. It acts as a data handler but is not responsible for rendering the video.

### **4. How to Fix the Issue**

To make the skeleton visible, you need to add an element in your React UI to display the processed frames you are receiving from the backend.

Here is the conceptual fix:

1.  **Modify the Backend `main.py`:** Ensure the data sent back includes the image data as a base64 encoded string. It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "image_data": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ...",
      "metadata": { ... }
    }
    ```

2.  **Modify `App.js`:**

    - Create a new state variable to hold the image data string:
      ```javascript
      const [processedImage, setProcessedImage] = useState("");
      ```
    - Update your `handleProcessedFrame` function to set this new state:
      ```javascript
      const handleProcessedFrame = (data) => {
        setProcessedFrameData(data);
        if (data.image_data) {
          setProcessedImage(data.image_data);
        }
      };
      ```
    - Add an `<img>` tag in your JSX to render the processed image. This should be placed inside the `streaming-area` div.
      ```javascript
      <div className="streaming-area">
        <h3>Processed Video Stream</h3>
        {streamingActive && processedImage ? (
          <img
            src={processedImage}
            alt="Processed Stream"
            style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "640px" }}
          />
        ) : (
          <div className="video-placeholder">
            <p>Processed stream will appear here</p>
          </div>
        )}
        {/* ... your existing metadata display ... */}
      </div>
      ```

By adding this `<img>` tag and feeding it the image data you're already receiving, the video stream with the visible MediaPipe skeleton will appear in your application.
