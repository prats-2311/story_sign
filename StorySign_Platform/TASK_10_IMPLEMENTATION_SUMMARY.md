# Task 10 Implementation Summary: Create Video Display Component with Processed Frame Rendering

## Overview

Task 10 has been successfully completed, implementing a comprehensive video display component with processed frame rendering, real-time performance monitoring, and system health indicators. The implementation provides a complete end-to-end video processing and display pipeline for the StorySign ASL Platform.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ProcessedVideoDisplay Component (`frontend/src/ProcessedVideoDisplay.js`)

**Core Features:**

- **Canvas-based Frame Rendering**: Uses HTML5 canvas for efficient processed frame display
- **Real-time MediaPipe Overlays**: Displays hand, face, and pose landmark detection status
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks frame rate, latency, and video quality metrics
- **Connection Health**: Monitors WebSocket connection status and uptime
- **System Health Indicators**: Visual indicators for WebSocket, video stream, latency, and detection quality

**Key Functionality:**

- Renders processed frames with MediaPipe overlays directly on canvas
- Calculates real-time performance metrics (FPS, latency, quality assessment)
- Provides comprehensive performance dashboard with historical data
- Displays MediaPipe landmark detection status with visual indicators
- Implements connection retry functionality with user-friendly error handling

### 2. Enhanced Styling (`frontend/src/App.css`)

**New CSS Classes Added:**

- `.processed-video-display` - Main component container
- `.video-display-header` - Connection status and controls
- `.performance-dashboard` - Metrics and performance monitoring
- `.landmarks-status` - MediaPipe detection visualization
- `.system-health` - Health indicators for system components
- `.health-indicator` - Individual health status displays

**Visual Features:**

- Color-coded status indicators (green/orange/red for different states)
- Responsive grid layouts for metrics display
- Loading states and placeholders for different connection states
- Professional dashboard-style interface with clear visual hierarchy

### 3. App.js Integration

**Changes Made:**

- Imported and integrated `ProcessedVideoDisplay` component
- Replaced simple image display with comprehensive video display component
- Connected all required props: `processedFrameData`, `connectionStatus`, `streamingStats`, `onRetryConnection`, `isActive`
- Maintained existing error handling and retry functionality

### 4. VideoStreamingClient Updates

**Enhanced Features:**

- Exposed frame statistics (`framesSent`, `framesReceived`) via `useImperativeHandle`
- Added connection status and error information for parent components
- Improved error reporting and connection monitoring
