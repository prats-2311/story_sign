# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem

The MediaPipe video stream with skeleton and landmarks was not showing after story generation due to WebSocket connection issues. The error messages showed:

- "WebSocket not connected, cannot send frame"
- "Disconnected - Not connected to video processing server"

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Dependency Initialization Issue**: The WebSocket endpoint dependencies (`connection_manager` and `VideoProcessingService`) were not being set properly during startup.
2. **Double WebSocket Accept**: The connection manager was trying to accept the WebSocket connection again after it was already accepted in the endpoint.
3. **Missing Error Handling**: The WebSocket endpoint lacked proper error handling for dependency failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Endpoint Dependencies

- Added fallback logic to create temporary instances when global dependencies are not available
- Improved error handling and logging for dependency initialization
- Added graceful degradation when services are not properly initialized

### 2. Fixed Connection Manager

- Removed duplicate `websocket.accept()` call from connection manager
- Separated connection registration from video service creation
- Added `register_processing_service()` method for proper service management

### 3. Enhanced Connection Stability

- Added periodic health checks with ping/pong mechanism
- Implemented automatic reconnection logic in frontend
- Added keepalive messages during long operations
- Improved connection recovery after story generation

### 4. Frontend Improvements

- Added automatic WebSocket reconnection after story generation
- Enhanced connection health monitoring
- Better error handling and recovery logic

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

- `StorySign_Platform/backend/api/websocket.py`: Enhanced error handling and dependency management
- `StorySign_Platform/backend/main.py`: Fixed connection manager to avoid double WebSocket accept

### Frontend Changes

- `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/components/video/VideoStreamingClient.js`: Added health checks and better error handling
- `StorySign_Platform/frontend/src/pages/ASLWorldPage.js`: Added auto-reconnection after story generation

## Test Results

✅ WebSocket connection establishes successfully
✅ Connection remains stable during story generation
✅ Ping/pong mechanism works correctly
✅ Frame processing works after story generation
✅ Automatic reconnection works
✅ Error handling and recovery work properly

## Impact

- MediaPipe video stream now works correctly after story generation
- Skeleton and landmarks display properly throughout the entire workflow
- Connection is more resilient to temporary issues
- Better user experience with automatic recovery

The fix ensures that the WebSocket connection for MediaPipe video streaming remains stable and functional throughout the entire StorySign application workflow, including during and after story generation processes.
