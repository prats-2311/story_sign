# Control Message Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unknown Message Type "control" Error

**Problem**: WebSocket endpoint was showing "Server error: unknown message type: control"
**Root Cause**: Missing handler for "control" message type in WebSocket endpoint
**Solution**: Added comprehensive control message handler

### 2. MediaPipe Cleanup Error

**Problem**: Error during cleanup: "Closing SolutionBase.\_graph which is already None"
**Root Cause**: MediaPipe trying to close an already closed graph
**Solution**: Added proper error handling in MediaPipe close method

## Changes Made

### Backend WebSocket Handler (`api/websocket.py`)

Added complete control message handler that supports:

- `start_session`: Initialize practice session with story data
- `next_sentence`: Move to next sentence in practice
- `try_again`: Retry current sentence
- `complete_story`: Complete the story practice
- `restart_story`: Restart story from beginning

```python
elif message_type == "control":
    # Handle practice control messages (start_session, next_sentence, etc.)
    action = message_data.get("action", "unknown")
    control_data = message_data.get("data", {})

    # Process control message through video service
    # Send appropriate response based on action
```

### MediaPipe Processor (`video_processor.py`)

Enhanced MediaPipe cleanup with proper error handling:

```python
def close(self):
    """Clean up MediaPipe resources"""
    if hasattr(self, 'holistic') and self.holistic is not None:
        try:
            self.holistic.close()
            self.logger.info("MediaPipe Holistic model closed")
        except ValueError as e:
            if "already None" in str(e):
                self.logger.debug("MediaPipe graph already closed")
            else:
                self.logger.warning(f"MediaPipe close warning: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error closing MediaPipe: {e}")
        finally:
            self.holistic = None
```

## Test Results

✅ Control messages are now properly handled
✅ No more "unknown message type: control" errors
✅ Practice session controls work correctly
✅ MediaPipe cleanup errors resolved
✅ WebSocket connection remains stable

## Message Types Supported

### Control Messages

- **start_session**: Start practice with story data
- **next_sentence**: Advance to next sentence
- **try_again**: Retry current sentence
- **complete_story**: Mark story as complete
- **restart_story**: Restart from beginning

### Response Messages

- **practice_session_response**: Response to session start
- **control_response**: Response to control actions
- **error**: Error responses with details

## Impact

The fixes ensure that:

1. ASL World practice session controls work properly
2. No more WebSocket errors for control messages
3. Clean MediaPipe resource cleanup
4. Better error handling and user feedback
5. Stable WebSocket connection throughout practice sessions

The MediaPipe video stream with skeleton and landmarks should now work correctly with all practice session controls.
